Arduino based LDR(light dependent resistor) volume and source selection controller which is based on Vincent77 at www.diyaudio.com site.


Following LDR features are described in diyaudio site. 
- customizable impedance, between 5kohm and 50kohm
- customizable number of attenuation steps, between 20 and 80
- you do not need matched LDRs
- LOG attenuation curve
- you can display your own welcome messages on the LCD screen
- remote controlled with any Apple remote
- rotary encoder with push button
- controls up to 6 input and output stereo channels
- I/O switching is done with best quality latching relays with Silver-Palladium contacts, to avoid any degradation of the musical signal
- the controller remembers the settings after power off
- can control a delay relay to soft-start a tube preamplifier
- achieves a large attenuation range by increasing series resistance at very high attenuation level and by increasing shunt resistance at very low attenuation level
- the calibration compensates for the load impedance effect
- the on-board calibration relays are best quality and they are powered only during calibration
- the LDR LEDs are working at low current (7 mA maximum), they will last a very long time
- the controller is isolated from the audio ground to avoid noise and loops
- separate linear analog and digital low noise power supplies
- power supplies on separate board, to keep the power transformer far from audio circuits
- easy to calibrate anytime from a menu â€“ no need to plug jumpers or an external module
- better audio quality than R-2R relay attenuators (no multiple relay contacts and solder joints in the signal path, no noisy relay coils)
